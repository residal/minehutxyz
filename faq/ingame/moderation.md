# Banning, Muting and Kicking Users

## Banning Users

You can ban users from your Minehut server using `/ban <name> [reason]`, you can also temporarily ban them with `'/tempban <user> <duration {1m, 1h, 1d, etc}> [reason]`.
To unban a player, the vanilla comamnd is `/pardon <player>` however if you are using essentials or a moderation plugin such as LiteBans, you may use `/unban <player>`.

## Muting Users

To mute a user, install essentials and/or a moderation plugin, then you can type `/mute <player> [reason` or `/mute <player> <duration> [reason]`.

## Kicking Users

To kick a user, use `/kick <player> [reason]`.

**NOTE:** Arguments between `< >` are required and `[ ]` are optional.
