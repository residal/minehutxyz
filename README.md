## ABOUT US

Minehut.xyz was founded on **_August 4th, 2020_** by two members of the Minehut Community, **Tarna** _\(Senior Support @ Minehut\)_ & **Minehut** _\(Adam, Senior Support @ Minehut\)_.

We realised there was no dedicated place for Minehut tutorials where the community can easily upload their own tutorials, so we made one!
